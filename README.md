This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 related to catch-all routes ('/*').  The issue arises when a catch-all route is defined after more specific routes. Even if a URL matches a specific route, the catch-all route might unexpectedly activate.  The solution provided addresses this behavior, ensuring that catch-all routes are used only when no other route matches.
